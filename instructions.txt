---------- 1: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL PRE-REQ'S AND DEPENDANCIES ----------

Pre-req's:

A linux OS
- provides an environment to run all our linux based commands
- I use Bash on Ubuntu (need to enable developer mode in order to get it)
- Should have at least version 16.04; Check by running 'lsb_release -a' in Bash

pip & pip3
- used to conveniently install all our python packages 
- https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-16-04/
- also run 'sudo apt-get install python3-pip' to get pip3

ngrok
- since we don't have a server to host on yet, we will use ngrok to localhost our code
- https://ngrok.com/download
- for this pre-req, just download the .exe file and put it wherever you want

Dependancies:

Python 3.6
- http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/07/install-python-3-6-1-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/

Flask
- Our Web framework
- to install, run 'pip3 install Flask==0.12.2' in Bash

Pymessenger
- A python wrapper for Facebook Messenger
- to instal, run 'pip3 install pymessenger' in Bash

---------- 2: FACEBOOK DEVELOPER DETAILS ----------

The facebook account created to test our app:
user: rob.otman1@hotmail.com
pass: compass123

The email account used to create it:
userL rob.otman1@hotmail.com
pass: compass123

The Page linked to the Messenger Bot is called 'Rob Otman - Estate Management Bot'

To access our app details on facebook developer: 
- Use the Facebook account to login to developers.facebook.com
- Our app is called EM Messenger Bot

---------- 3: RUNNING THE APP ----------

1. Run our code
-  navigate to the place where you cloned our repository into using Ubuntu
-  run 'python3 app.py'
-  Should say something like '* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTR+C to quit)'

2. Make code accessible to others by using ngrok
-  Open another terminal up that has access to your base OS, and navigate to where you stored the 'ngrok.exe'
-  I used Windows PowerShell
-  run 'ngrok http [number]', where [number] is the port number (the number that came after the ':' after we ran our code)
-  for me on windows, I ran '.\ngrok http 5000' in windows powershell (the extra '.\' tells the system that ngrok is in the current directory)
-  You should see ~5 rows of session information to indicate ngrok succeeded 
-  the link after the second 'forwarding' row is the link that other people would use to access your app
-  should look something like 'https://6de80da7.ngrok.io' (the random string will be different each time ngrok is run)

3. Provide the URL generated to Facebook
-  go to the 'EM Messenger Bot' app details on our Facebook Developer page
-  go to 'Webhooks' on the LHS navigation
-  click Edit Subscription
-  paste the link provided by ngrok into Callback URL 
-  (A Webhook is just a URL that other people use to communicate with our app)
-  paste 'TESTING_TOKEN_0987654321' into Verify Token field
-  (the Verify Token field is a token that we make up, and is stored in the app.py code.)
-  (This token is a security measure used by Facebook to verify the bot only responds to requests sent from messenger)
-  Click verify and save
-  Facebook now uses this URL to contact our app everytime the page receives a message

4. Bot is ready :D 
-  Login to the Rob Otman facebook account on Facebook
-  find our Rob Otman - Estate Management Bot page
-  message it
-  should receive a response
-  (Note: Since our App is in dev mode its not available to the public)
-  (only Rob Otman can test our code since Rob Otman is the app admin)
